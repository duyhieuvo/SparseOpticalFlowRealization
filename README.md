# SparseOpticalFlowRealization

Realize Lucas-Kanade optical flow on a sparse grid of interested pixels.
This approach of realization can help capture the overall structure of the motion in the scene while maintaining low calculating complexity.
The size of the grid is adjustable. The denser the grid, the more accurate the optical flow calculated but with more computations required.
